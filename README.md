The project "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Algorithmic Trading with Transformer Model" explores the application of state-of-the-art techniques to develop an intelligent trading agent. Using historical price data from the last 60 days, a small Transformer model is employed to make buy, sell, or hold decisions. Reinforcement learning is used to train the agent to maximize returns over multiple trading episodes. The agent utilizes an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy for better exploration-exploitation trade-off. By training on synthetic price data, the model learns to make informed decisions in a risk-controlled manner. The project highlights the potential of advanced deep learning techniques in the field of algorithmic trading, while recognizing the complexity and risks associated with real-world financial markets.
